- Insane CLI SDK API for no reason (other than being reall fun to use for devs):
	- some good customizing on browser GUI but
		- insane customizing for investigations, locations, and users available in terminal:
			- templates for investigations
			- templates for locations (private)
			- templates for evidence:
				- radio form:
					- audio
					- video
					- photo
					- text
- Allow everyone the chance to try out a paranormal experiment

- Public locations will be allowed for users that have been verified as "safe" members 
	- no hateful language
	- no condescending language
	- only welcoming, enthusiastic or community positive activity allowed
	- gameify the verification:
		- some metric of stored investigations
		- some metric of visited locations
		- some metric of identification (abstracted from users)
			- an almost celebrity persona 
				- something unique needed 
- sincerity for forums
	- religion is respected and tolerated as long as it is not:
		- abusively persuasive
		- inspiring violence 
		- inspiring hate
		- manipulating users
		- cult - manipulative
	- productive japes and jokes
	- knowledge and advice standards:
		- productive
		- non repetitive
		- reasonably replicable
		- non religious:
			- no "messages from god"
			- no "changing your ways"
			- no "soul purity" bullshit
			- no "chosen alien contactee" bullshit
